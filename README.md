## How to Use
This is the source code for my personal portfolio site where I brag about myself and show off my projects. Feel free to use my source code as inspiration or templates for your own sites/projects. To get started, follow these instructions:

1) Clone this repository onto your local machine
2) Run `bower install` and `npm install` to install the necessary bower and node packages
3) Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` - this will spin up a localhost server on port 8000 that you can use to view code
4) Run `grunt watch` so that updates to SCSS will compile to a CSS file
5) Run `grunt prod` when you're ready to push production - this will spin up a number of Grunt tasks like JS minification, image minification, SCSS compilation, etc.

## Tech Used
* Bulma
* Bower
* Grunt
* AOS (Animate on Scroll)
